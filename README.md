## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Type safety JS language
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

1. TypeScript

- Statically-typed superset of JavaScript
- Optional type annotations
- Catch errors, better code completion and navigation tools
- Improves code maintainability and reduces runtime errors

2. Responsive Design

- Approach to web design that aims to create website that looks good on any device
- Uses techniques like fluid layouts, flexible images, and media queries
- Mobile-first design is a common strategy for creating responsive websites

3. Hover States

- Visual changes when user hovers over an interactive element on a webpage
- Provides feedback to the user and improves the user experience
- CSS pseudo-classes like `:hover` can be used to apply hover states to elements on a webpage.

Overall, I learned that TypeScript improves code quality, responsive design is essential for user-friendly websites, and hover states can enhance the user experience.
